module Chem::IO
  # Registers a file format.
  #
  # A file type associates extensions and/or file names with a file format, and links
  # the latter to the annotated classes. If the file format does not exist, it is
  # registered.
  #
  # This annotation accepts the file format (required), and either an array of
  # extensions (without leading dot) or an array of file names, or both. File names can
  # include wildcards (*) to denote either prefix (e.g., "Foo*"), suffix (e.g., "*Bar"),
  # or both (e.g., "*Baz*").
  #
  # ```
  # @[RegisterFormat(format: Log, ext: %w(txt log out), names: %w(LOG *OUT))]
  # class LogParser
  # end
  # ```
  annotation RegisterFormat; end
